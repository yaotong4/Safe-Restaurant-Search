# safe-restaurant-search

This is a full-stack group project that built a COVID-Safe restaurant search application that enables users to search based on customized search criteria such as restaurant name, location, minimum rating, categories, and most importantly COVID safety. A Safety Index was used for each restaurant in the scale of 0 to 1 to indicate the risk of infection when dining in that restaurant. It is calculated based on the COVID statistics in a county, compared to those of all other counties in the same state.
